lotr <- tribble(
                         ~film,    ~race, ~female, ~male,
  "The Fellowship Of The Ring",    "Elf",   1229L,  971L,

## Your Turn 1

Use `gather()` to reorganize `table4a` into three columns: **country**, **year**, and **cases**.

```{r}

```

## Your Turn 2

1. Use `spread()` to reorganize `table2` into four columns: **country**, **year**, **cases**, and **population**. 
2. Create a new variable called `prevalence` that divides `cases` by `population` multiplied by 100000.

```{r}
table2
```

## Your Turn 3

Gather the 5th through 60th columns of `who` into a key column: value column pair named **codes** and **n**. Then select just the `county`, `year`, `codes` and `n` variables.

```{r}
who
```

## Your Turn 4

Use the `cases` data below. Separate the `sex_age` column into **sex** and **age** columns.

```{r}
cases <- tribble(
   ~id,     ~sex_age,
   "1",    "male_56",
   "2",  "female_77",    
   "3",  "female_49"
)
separate(_______, _______, into = c("_______", "_______"))
```

## Exam

There are two CSV files in this folder containing SEER data in breast cancer incidence in white and black women. For both sets of data:

1. Import the data
2. Gather the columns into 2 new columns called `year` and `incidence`
3. Add a new variable called `race`. Remember that each data set corresponds to a single race.
4. Bind the data sets together using `bind_rows()` from the dplyr package. Either save it as a new object or pipe the result directly into the ggplot2 code.
5. Plot the data using the code below. Fill in the blanks to have `year` on the x-axis, `incidence` on the y-axis, and `race` as the color aesthetic. 

```{r}


______ %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ______, y = ______, color = ______, group = race)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() + 
    scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1975, 2011, by = 5)) # show years by fives
```

# Take Aways

Data comes in many formats but R prefers just one: _tidy data_.

A data set is tidy if and only if:

1. Every variable is in its own column
2. Every observation is in its own row
3. Every value is in its own cell (which follows from the above)

What is a variable and an observation may depend on your immediate goal.

Implement the Newton-Raphson method of optimization as a funciton that receives
the 1st and 2nd derivative, and find the optimum (or zero root) of the following function:

1.  `f(x) = (x - pi)^3` (minimum at about pi)

2.  `f(x) = 10*sin(0.3*x)*sin(1.3*x^2) + 0.00001*x^4 + 0.2*x+80` (minimum close to -15.81515)
